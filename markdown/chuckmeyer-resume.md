SUMMARY
-------

I am an engineering generalist who enjoys chatting with other builders. When I am excited about a technology, that excitement shows through in everything I do. I code a bit, write a bit, and ask lots of questions.

TECH STACK
---------------

My current position focuses on frontend devs which means I've been learning JavaScript frameworks like React and NextJS. Previous infrastructure work was primarily in Python. I've also done a smidge of Go for CLIs. Very familiar with DevOps and CI/CD tooling for automated deployments using AWS services.
