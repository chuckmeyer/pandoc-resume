SUMMARY
-------

I am an engineering generalist who has dabbled in API-based development, security, DevOps, and cloud technologies. I have a keen interest in solving problems and communicating those solutions to others. I have designed, coded, deployed, blogged, presented and managed for engineering teams from FinTech to SaaS to government. 

I am a builder who enjoys working with other builders. When I am excited about a technology, that excitement shows through in everything I do.
