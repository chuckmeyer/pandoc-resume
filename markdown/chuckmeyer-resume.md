SUMMARY
-------

My focus is ensuring the security and stability of cloud-based 
applications through the use of rigorous deployment automation 
and testing for both infrastructure and application components.

SKILLS
------

* Designing resilient **AWS** cloud architectures for **EC2**-based and **Lambda**-based applications
* CI/CD and automation for infrastructure deployments using **Jenkins**, **Github**, **Travis CI**, etc.
* Development in **Python** for application backends and tools
* Some experience developing in **Node.js** and **Ruby**
* Security and compliance validation against CIS, PCI, HIPAA, etc. using automated testing and cloud controls like **cfn_nag**

EMPLOYMENT
----------

**Sr. Developer Advocate, AWS CloudFormation,**  
Amazon Web Services, August 2017 to present.

I report to the AWS CloudFormation service director and serve as a liason between the service team and the developer community. My objectives are to guide customers in following best practices, serving as a rallying point for the community, and voicing customer concerns back to the service team.

* I represent the developer community in service team planning sessions.

* I maintain CloudFormation's open source repositories:
  * [github.com/awslabs/cfn-python-lint](https://github.com/awslabs/cfn-python-lint/pulse)
  * [github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/pulse)

* I design and publish best practices and customer solutions for AWS' management tools blog:
  * ["Signaling AWS CloudFormation WaitConditions using AWS PrivateLink"](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/signaling-aws-cloudformation-waitconditions-using-aws-privatelink/)
  * ["Building an AWS CloudFormation custom resource to manage StackSets"](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/building-an-aws-cloudformation-custom-resource-to-manage-stacksets/)

* I speak at meetups and conferences about infrastructure code best practices:
  * ["Deployment Scenarios with AWS CloudFormation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X31kA1ANBVw)
  * ["Deep Dive on AWS CloudFormation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXUsyApAI3Y)

* I meet with customers and dive into ways to improve their infrastructure automation strategies.

**Security Solution Architect,**  
Amazon Web Services, April 2016 to August 2017.

I spoke with CISOs and security practitioners across North America on how they can improve
their IT security posture by building applications using AWS cloud services.

-   I reviewed customer cloud network topologies to suggest the proper
    use of account isolation, VPCs, subnets, NACLs, security groups, and
    partner software for connectivity to on premise networks.

-   I created AWS security labs around encryption, IAM, and
    infrastructure as code used at conferences, summits, and loft
    events.

-   I assisted customers with adapting their security models to rely less
    network perimeter controls and more on cloud-native solutions to provide
    better horizontal isolation and scaling for hybrid environments.

-   I helped customers understand actual risks and appropriate controls to
    encrypt their data at rest and in transit within the public cloud.

**Senior Professional Services Consultant**,  
Amazon Web Services, New York, NY, July 2013 to April 2016.

I helped large enterprises migrate critical workloads to Amazon\'s
public cloud and integrate Amazon\'s web services with their existing 
on-premises systems. My primary goal was to champion repeatable, secure 
deployment of infrastructure and applications through CI/CD and
configuration management along with the application of DevOps best practices 
at enterprise scale.

-   I designed and built a pipeline to harden RHEL7 Amazon Machine
    Images to help my customer achieve PCI compliance using Packer, 
    Puppet, and CloudFormation wrapped in custom Python code.

-   I sprinted with a customer's cloud team to construct a CI/CD
    pipeline for deploying AWS IAM Roles and Policies to meet delegation
    of duties requirements. The pipeline used CodeCommit, CodePipeline,
    Ansible, and CloudFormation. 

**Web Security Manager,**  
Federal Reserve/HP, Herndon, VA, January 2013 to July 2013.

I managed a technical team focused on web application/web service access
control. The team consisted of SMEs for access management (SiteMinder), 
PKI, LDAP and User Provisioning (Sun Identity Manager). We assisted our hosted 
applications in meeting their security requirements, responded to audit findings, 
and oversaw day-to-day operations. Specific management tasks included hiring, 
employee reviews, and workload redistribution.

**SiteMinder/DataPower Subject Matter Expert (Consultant),**  
Federal Reserve/HP, Herndon, VA, Feb. 2006 to January 2013.

I served as Subject Matter Expert to provide guidance and support for
the access management layer of a Government E-commerce Infrastructure.

**Senior Support Engineer**, **Premier Services,**
CA, Framingham, MA, Nov. 2004 to Feb. 2006.

**Senior Support Engineer**,
