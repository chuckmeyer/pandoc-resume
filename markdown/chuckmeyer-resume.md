SUMMARY
-------

I am an engineering generalist with a keen interest in solving problems and communicating those solutions to others. I have designed, coded, deployed, blogged, presented, and managed for over 25 years in the tech industry. I am a builder who is fascinated with other builders. When I am excited about a technology or company, that excitement shows through in everything I do.

I'm most interested in a role building out a Developer Advocate practice around a technology the world needs to know more about. Previously, I have advocated around API-based development, application and infrastructure security, DevOps, and infrastructure as code. I have worked with or presented to engineering teams across just about every vertical -- from FinTech to Gaming to Government.

EMPLOYMENT
----------

**Senior Engineer, Developer Relations and Integrations,**  
Bold Penguin, March 2019 to present.

I report to the CTO and work with our partners to accelerate their journey integrating with our products. This coud be anything from a single developer linking their Salesforce into our commercial insurance exchange or a large enterprise team connecting multiple bespoke backend systems into our quoting and binding platform.

In addition to direct interactions with our partner teams, I am constantly maintaining and improving documentation, working with our product teams advocating for enhancements, and writing and providing code examples and tips. I have consolidated all of these tools into our [Developers Portal](https://developers.boldpenguin.com) which has reduced the number of direct interactions required with our partners engineering teams and increased brand awareness within the InsureTech space.

**Senior Developer Advocate, AWS CloudFormation,**  
Amazon Web Services, August 2017 to March 2019.

I reported to the AWS CloudFormation service director and served as a liason between the service team and the developer community. My objectives were to guide customers in following best practices, serving as a rallying point for the community, and voicing customer concerns back to the service team.

- I represented the developer community in service team planning sessions.

- I maintained CloudFormation's open source repositories:
  - [github.com/awslabs/cfn-python-lint](https://github.com/awslabs/cfn-python-lint/pulse)
  - [github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/pulse)

- I designed and published best practices and customer solutions for AWS' management tools blog:
  - ["Signaling AWS CloudFormation WaitConditions using AWS PrivateLink"](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/signaling-aws-cloudformation-waitconditions-using-aws-privatelink/)
  - ["Building an AWS CloudFormation custom resource to manage StackSets"](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/building-an-aws-cloudformation-custom-resource-to-manage-stacksets/)

- I spoke at meetups and conferences about infrastructure code best practices:
  - ["Deployment Scenarios with AWS CloudFormation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X31kA1ANBVw)
  - ["Deep Dive on AWS CloudFormation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXUsyApAI3Y)

- I met with customers and dive into ways to improve their infrastructure automation strategies.

**Security Solution Architect,**  
Amazon Web Services, April 2016 to August 2017.

I spoke with CISOs and security practitioners across North America on how they can improve
their IT security posture by building applications using AWS cloud services.

-  I reviewed customer cloud network topologies to suggest the proper
    use of account isolation, VPCs, subnets, NACLs, security groups, and
    partner software for connectivity to on premise networks.

-   I created AWS security labs around encryption, IAM, and
    infrastructure as code used at conferences, summits, and loft
    events.

-   I assisted customers with adapting their security models to rely less
    network perimeter controls and more on cloud-native solutions to provide
    better horizontal isolation and scaling for hybrid environments.

-   I helped customers understand actual risks and appropriate controls to
    encrypt their data at rest and in transit within the public cloud.

**Senior Professional Services Consultant**,  
Amazon Web Services, New York, NY, July 2013 to April 2016.

I helped large enterprises migrate critical workloads to Amazon\'s
public cloud and integrate Amazon\'s web services with their existing 
on-premises systems. My primary goal was to champion repeatable, secure 
deployment of infrastructure and applications through CI/CD and
configuration management along with the application of DevOps best practices 
at enterprise scale.

-   I designed and built a pipeline to harden RHEL7 Amazon Machine
    Images to help my customer achieve PCI compliance using Packer, 
    Puppet, and CloudFormation wrapped in custom Python code.

-   I sprinted with a customer's cloud team to construct a CI/CD
    pipeline for deploying AWS IAM Roles and Policies to meet delegation
    of duties requirements. The pipeline used CodeCommit, CodePipeline,
    Ansible, and CloudFormation. 

**Web Security Manager,**  
Federal Reserve/HP, Herndon, VA, January 2013 to July 2013.

I managed a technical team focused on web application/web service access
control. The team consisted of SMEs for access management (SiteMinder), 
PKI, LDAP and User Provisioning (Sun Identity Manager). We assisted our hosted 
applications in meeting their security requirements, responded to audit findings, 
and oversaw day-to-day operations. Specific management tasks included hiring, 
employee reviews, and workload redistribution.

**SiteMinder/DataPower Subject Matter Expert (Consultant),**  
Federal Reserve/HP, Herndon, VA, Feb. 2006 to January 2013.

**Senior Support Engineer**, **Premier Services,**
CA, Framingham, MA, Nov. 2004 to Feb. 2006.

**Senior Support Engineer**,
Netegrity, Waltham, MA, May 2002 to November 2004.

**Professional Services Consultant**,
