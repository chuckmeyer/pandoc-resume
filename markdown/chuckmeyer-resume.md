SUMMARY
-------

I'm interested in a role building out a Developer Advocate practice for a
technology the world needs to know more about. I have advocated around API-based
development, security, DevOps, and cloud technologies. I am an engineering
generalist with a keen interest in solving problems and communicating those
solutions to others. I have designed, coded, deployed, blogged, presented and
managed for engineering teams across just about every vertical -- from FinTech
to Gaming to Government.

I am a builder who is fascinated with other builders. When I am excited about a
technology or company, that excitement shows through in everything I do.

through CI/CD and configuration management along with the application of DevOps
best practices at enterprise scale.

    Images to help my customer achieve PCI compliance using Packer,
